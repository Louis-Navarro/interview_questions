Interview Questions
===================
This repository contains my code to interview questions found on the web

## Why ?
I decided to make this repository to show the recuiters what I am able to do.

## Tree
This repository is made out of folders. Each folder represents a single coding
question.
In each folder, there is :

* The file containing the code,
  * If the question only has one part, then the file is `main.py`
  * If the question has multiple parts, then the files will be named `part_{part_number}.py`
* A file containing the question and a link to it (`info.txt`),
* If needed, a file containing data (`data.json`).
